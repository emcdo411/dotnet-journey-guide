## 🧠 What Is .NET?

**.NET** is a free, open-source development platform built by Microsoft that lets developers build apps for:

* Web
* Desktop
* Mobile
* Cloud
* Gaming
* IoT

It supports **multiple languages** (like C#, F#, and VB.NET) and runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

> If you're writing C# code, you're most likely using some version of the .NET platform to compile and run it.

## 🏢 Why It Matters to Microsoft and Modern Apps

.NET is the **backbone of Microsoft’s software ecosystem**, powering:

* Microsoft 365
* Azure Cloud Services
* Visual Studio
* Enterprise apps at Fortune 500 companies

It gives developers:

* A unified platform for web, mobile, and desktop
* Access to modern cloud-native features
* Excellent tooling through Visual Studio and GitHub

> Without .NET, modern Microsoft platforms and services wouldn’t scale, integrate, or evolve at today’s speed.

## ⚖️ Difference Between .NET Framework and .NET Core / .NET 5+

| Feature                 | .NET Framework           | .NET Core / .NET 5+            |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------------ |
| 🛍️ Platform Support    | Windows-only             | Cross-platform (Win/Mac/Linux) |
| 🚀 Performance          | Slower                   | Faster & more scalable         |
| 🛠 Updates              | Legacy (minimal updates) | Actively updated               |
| 🧩 App Types Supported  | Web, Desktop (WinForms)  | Web, Desktop, Mobile, Cloud    |
| 🔗 Open Source          | No                       | Yes                            |
| 🧱 Modular Architecture | Monolithic               | Modular                        |

> .NET Core was renamed to ".NET 5+" starting in 2020 as part of Microsoft's unification plan.

## 🔄 Compilation Workflow: From C# to Execution

When you write a C# program, it goes through a special process before it runs:

1. **C# Source Code (.cs)**  → Written by the developer
2. **Compiler (csc.exe)**  → Translates your code to MSIL (Microsoft Intermediate Language)
3. **MSIL**  → A CPU-independent set of instructions
4. **CLR (Common Language Runtime)** → Converts MSIL to native machine code using:

   * **JIT (Just-In-Time Compiler)** at runtime
5. **App Runs on Your Device**
